# License Plate Detection

The ultimate goal of this project is to be able to remotely detect, track, and read
license plates in real time. 

## How It's Made
**Tools Used** : TKinter, MatPlotLib, Numpy, XML, YOLOv8 
This project uses the YOLOv8 model to detect multiple license plates in real time.

## How To Use

Please run "UI.py" which will open the widget that prompts the user to input 
a png file of their choice. It will then display the image with the predicted license
plates highlighted.
